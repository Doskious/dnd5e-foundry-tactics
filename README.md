# dnd5e-foundry-tactics

This is a Steam Workshop mod for GM Forge (https://store.steampowered.com/app/842250/GM_Forge__Virtual_Tabletop/).

It is posted on the Steam Workshop here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1418538974

Alternatively, you can install it directly from this source, however it will not receive automatic updates so the Steam approach is the recommended option. You will need to extract this folder to the following location:
`<YOUR_STEAM_LOCATION>\Steam\SteamApps\common\GM Forge - Virtual Tabletop\public\workshop`.

## NOTE - This project has been discontinued by the original author.

I have decided to move on to a new challenge working on virtual tabletop related projects in my own independent space. I apologize to the GM Forge community who was looking forward to further work on Foundry Tactics, but I'm excited to tackle a new and more ambitious challenge with Foundry Virtual Tabletop (http://foundryvtt.com).

Please feel free to submit pull requests if there are issues you would like to see addressed (or fork your own branch).
